# trafficbot
This is a simple python script authored by me to demonstrate how easy it is to generate traffic for your website to improve your google ranking and do other black SEO . 

Using Tor Addon in your default browser is essential to make the clicks on links count. This way the IP address keeps changing with every new request , fooling the web server that these requests are from diffrent IP's . 

It is to be understood that this is no professional tool , but can be used to generate huge volumes of traffic for your blogs/website . 


HELP and SUPPORT

Add up as many URLs as you need for a single loop. Just keep adding the new line :

webbrowser.open_new_tab('http://url/') time.sleep(10)

http://url/ -> Can be replaced with your Link where you want the Traffic to be generated .

time.sleep(10) -> Makes sure your browser does'nt Crash . 



Make sure you run a Proxy on your browser otherwise maybe the Analystics dont consider clicks in Counts . 

If you want to create this bot more powerful then you also use selenium for web scrapping and automate views and clicks on your website.
